        <p>Hello! My name is khushpreet kaur. Every friend of mine call me khushi.I am from india.I am currently
            pursuing a diploma in <em>media design</em>.In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies,listening music,and
            spending time with family and friends. If I talk about my one of hobbies then movies are not just
            entertainment for me; they are a way to relax.My best friend is Prabhjot who is living in brampton.My
            favorite color is Pink.

        <p> My dream is to become a web designer.I believe that every design   tells a story.I recently learned how to
            build a simple website, and one thing I found interesting was learning how to write particular characters
            like E=mc<sup>2</sup> in code.I am excited to learn more about websities because it will help me to achieve
            my goals. I would have to say one of my biggest strenghts is my curiosity-I am always want learn new
            things, especially in technologhy. I am looking forward towards my future as web designer.
